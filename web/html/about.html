    <h1>There isn't much to say about this webpage. It's very much just a test for bun, getting used to GIT,
        specifically github and (slightly) netlify. Branches as well.</h1>
    <p> I sound like a broken record, but I genuinely don't know what to say except describing the purpose of this
        webpage. Which is the only content it'll have. And all I have to say about the webpage. And its content. </p>
